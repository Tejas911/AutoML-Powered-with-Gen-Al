            # the setup code is going to be in diff file
            similarly we are going to get the parameters generated with help of LLM
            
            ### Feature engineering :
            setup(data=data, target='Purchase', 
            categorical_features=['StoreID'], 
            polynomial_features=True,
            feature_interaction=True,
            bin_numeric_features=['Age'],
            target_encoding=True,
            normalize=True, 
            transformation=True)

            ### Feature Selection:
            setup(data=data, target='Purchase', 
            feature_selection=True, 
            feature_selection_threshold=0.9)  # Example threshold

            ### Feature Imputation: 
            Strategy :
            Low Missingness (<5%): Basic strategies like mean, median, or mode imputation often work well.
            Moderate Missingness (5â€“30%): More advanced imputation methods or model-based techniques might be better.
            High Missingness (>30%): Consider whether imputation is appropriate, or if the feature should be dropped.
